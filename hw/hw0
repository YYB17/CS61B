In this assignment, we will go through basic Java syntax concepts.

Defining Functions(a.k.a. Methods): 

    public static int max(int x, int y) {
         if (x > y) {
            return x;
        }
        return y;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(max(10, 15));
    }
    
Arrays: 

    int[] numbers = new int[3];
    numbers[0] = 4;
    numbers[1] = 7;
    numbers[2] = 10;
    System.out.println(numbers[1]);
    
    Or
    
    int[] numbers = new int[]{4, 7, 10};
    System.out.println(numbers[1]);
    
    
For Loops: 
    public class ClassNameHere {
    /** Uses a basic for loop to sum a. */
        public static int sum(int[] a) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i = i + 1) {
             sum = sum + a[i];
            }
            return sum;
        }
    }
    
 Break and Continue: 
    The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop, effectively jumping straight to the increment condition. By contrast, 
    the break keyword completely terminates the innermost loop when it is called. 
    
 The Enhanced For Loop:
    The basic idea is that there are many circumstances where we donâ€™t actually care about the index at all. 
    In this case, we avoid creating an index variable using a special syntax involving a colon.
    
    in this case, we do not create an index i. 
    Instead, the String s takes on the identity of each String in a exactly once, starting from a[0], all the way up to a[a.length - 1].

    public class EnhancedForBreakDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String[] a = {"cat", "dog", "laser horse", "ketchup", "horse", "horbse"};

            for (String s : a) {
                for (int j = 0; j < 3; j += 1) {
                    System.out.println(s);
                    if (s.contains("horse")) {
                        break;
                    }                
                }
            }
        }
    }
